        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s06_l01">
            <li>The United States and Canada are two countries with a great deal in common: their large territories, their histories of European colonization, their immigrant populations, and their high standards of living.</li>
            <li>Both the United States and Canada are becoming less European as immigrants arrive from outside Europe. In the case of the United States, the largest group of immigrants is from Latin America. For Canada, the largest group of immigrants is from Asia.</li>
            <li>The United States and Canada are both countries with a small native population, although in Canada native people have achieved more self-representation than in the United States, especially since the creation of Nunavut.</li>
            <li>Quebec, the French-speaking heart of Canada, has struggled for years to maintain its cultural uniqueness without risking its economic well-being.</li>
            <li>Both countries are postindustrial, with service- and information-oriented economies. The United States is the worldâ€™s largest economy, and it has a history of spreading its culture, ideas, and military prowess around the globe.</li>
            <li>North America is made up of various regions with distinct cultural or physical features. Each region has majority and minority populations based on immigration or native heritage. Economic conditions vary from region to region. The Sun Belt is attracting an ever-growing number of information-based high-tech firms.</li>
