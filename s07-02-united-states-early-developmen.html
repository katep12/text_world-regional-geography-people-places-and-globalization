        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p01">With abundant resources and opportunity, the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">original thirteen colonies</a><span class="glossdef">The colonies of Britain in North America that fought the American Revolution and became the United States.</span></span> prospered and expanded into what became the fifty US states. The political geography of this nation was a product of various treaties and acquisitions that eventually resulted in the country extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean. Fueling the expansion was the concept of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Manifest Destiny</a><span class="glossdef">The belief that it was the duty and destiny of Americans to continue to move westward and conquer all the land between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.</span></span>: the belief of some Americans that the new nation was divinely predestined to expand across the continent. The United States negotiated with France for the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, acquiring millions of acres in the central United States (see <a class="xref" href="#berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_f02">Figure 4.5 "Geopolitical Map of the Creation of the United States from the Atlantic to the Pacific"</a>). Florida was acquired from Spain in 1819, and Texas was annexed in 1845. The British sold portions of the Pacific Northwest to the United States, and the exact northern boundary between the United States and Canada was settled in 1846. Through conflicts with Mexico, large portions of the West were ceded to the United States in the mid-nineteenth century. Alaska was purchased from the Russians in 1867 for only $7.2 million. Alaska and Hawaii were the last two possessions to enter into statehood, which they did in 1959.</p>

In its magnificent domain of space and time, the nation of many nations is destined to manifest to mankind the excellence of divine principles; to establish on earth the noblest temple ever dedicated to the worship of the Most High—the Sacred and the True. Its floor shall be a hemisphere—its roof the firmament of the star-studded heavens, and its congregation an Union of many Republics, comprising hundreds of happy millions, calling, owning no man master, but governed by God’s natural and moral law of equality, the law of brotherhood—of “peace and good will amongst men.”<span class="footnote" hidden id="berglee_1.0-fn04_002">“John L.

With victory over Spain in the Spanish-American War of 1898, the US government gained control of the Philippines, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Guam, and various Pacific islands. Cuba and the Philippines later became independent countries, but Puerto Rico and Guam continue to be part of the United States. The US Virgin Islands were purchased from Denmark in 1918 after World War I as a location to provide strategic military support to protect the shipping lanes through the Caribbean and the Panama Canal.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Westward Settlement Patterns and European Immigration</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p01">The thirteen original colonies are often grouped into three regions, each with its own economic and cultural patterns. These three areas—New England, the Mid-Atlantic, and the South—are considered <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">culture hearths</a><span class="glossdef">The place where a new culture forms and from which it spreads.</span></span>, or places where culture formed and from which it spread. The three regions were source areas for westward migration, and migrants from these regions carried with them the cultural traditions of their culture hearths. New England was characterized by poor soils, subsistence agriculture, and fishing communities and was the birthplace of North America’s Industrial Revolution. Its largest city was Boston. Settlers from New England traveled west across New York State and into the upper Midwest and the Great Lakes region. The Mid-Atlantic region, focused on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was known for its fertile soils, prosperous small-scale agriculture, and multinational population. Prosperous farming led to a vibrant economy and a robust network of towns and cities. People who wanted to migrate west from this region traveled down the <strong class="emphasis bold">Great Valley</strong> into the <strong class="emphasis bold">Appalachian Mountains</strong> and across the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cumberland Gap</strong> into Kentucky, or they crossed Pennsylvania and traveled west via the Ohio River valley. The heart of the South was Virginia, a region oriented around plantation agriculture. The South was overwhelmingly rural, and in time the bulk of its agricultural workforce consisted of slaves brought to the United States from Subsaharan Africa.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p02">Westward migration was spurred along by the gold boom in California (1849) and by the completion of the transcontinental railroad (1869). The settlement frontier pushed westward during the course of the nineteenth century and was declared “closed” by the Bureau of the Census in 1890. This did not mean that settlers were spread uniformly across the continent by 1890; indeed, vast areas of the Great Plains and the mountain west remained sparsely populated by Europeans at that time. The Homestead Act of 1862 also encouraged westward migration by offering 160 acres of free land to households willing to move west. The continental United States had been organized into official states by the end of the nineteenth century, except Oklahoma (1907), Arizona (1912), and New Mexico (1912).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s02_p03">Most US residents at its founding in 1776 had roots in Great Britain, with large numbers from other northern and western European countries and many others from Africa (most of whom were slaves in the South). During the nineteenth century, migrants continued to immigrate to the United States as its economy grew, especially after the 1830s. Germans and Irish began arriving in large numbers, joining others from Britain and other countries, predominantly those in western Europe. As the century progressed, others from southern and eastern Europe, from countries such as Italy, Russia, and Austria, became the most significant stream of immigrants to the United States. The new arrivals were different from the early British immigrants: they practiced Roman Catholic or Eastern Orthodox Christianity (not Protestantism), they primarily moved to urban areas, and they found work in the new manufacturing sector growing rapidly in the Northeast and around the Great Lakes. Very few immigrants came from Latin America or Asia at that time.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Industrial Development and Urbanization</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_p01">The <strong class="emphasis bold">Industrial Revolution</strong> that began in Great Britain in the late eighteenth century eventually moved across the Atlantic and took hold in the United States. Rapid industrial growth emerged in the nineteenth century and was focused in the northeastern United States around the Great Lakes in an area called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Manufacturing Belt</a><span class="glossdef">The upper Midwest and the northeastern United States; the heart of the early manufacturing sector.</span></span> (<a class="xref" href="#berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_f01">Figure 4.7 "Manufacturing Belt Turned Rust Belt"</a>). Mechanized manufacturing began with textiles (New England), moved to steel and other metals (Pennsylvania and Indiana), and later was dominated by the manufacture of automobiles (Michigan). Of course, manufacturing would not have been possible without an abundant supply of power. Coal mining became an important industry in western Pennsylvania and in Appalachia.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_p02">Manufacturing took place in the cities and towns of the Manufacturing Belt. Not until the second half of the twentieth century did manufacturing move to rural areas; until then, it was almost entirely an urban activity. As the United States went through its Industrial Revolution, its population shifted from being almost entirely rural to being mostly urban. In 1790, only about 5 percent of the US population lived in urban areas; by 1920, about 50 percent lived in cities. As the rural to urban shift took place, the function and form of US cities also changed.</p>

Because most Americans lived on farms, cities were small, compact, and centrally oriented: everything was located within walking distance. Only wealthy people had access to transportation by horse, and city dwellers needed to live within a short distance of where they worked, shopped, and carried out all their activities. The invention of the electric streetcar (1888) allowed cities to increase in size. People could live farther from their place of employment as long as they lived within walking distance of a streetcar line. Streetcar suburbs grew up along streetcar lines, and these neighborhoods were often segregated by ethnicity and race. Fewer people lived in downtowns, which became dedicated to retail and manufacturing. Cities remained oriented around a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">central business district (CBD)</a><span class="glossdef">The location in a city that is considered the downtown, characterized by high rents and high density of buildings and commerce.</span></span>, which was often located near the railway station. Factories needed to be near modes of transportation for both shipping in parts and shipping out completed products and so that workers could easily get to work.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_p04">Large numbers of middle class Americans began acquiring automobiles after about 1920; this eventually led to a complete rethinking of the spatial layout of the city. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Automobile suburbs</a><span class="glossdef">A residential area outside the city center to which people commute by automobile.</span></span> sprang up outside the traditional city limits as people were able to buy homes far from streetcar lines or railway stations. Cities became increasingly decentralized: people could go shopping in suburban malls instead of downtown department stores, factories could spring up at highway interchanges and not only near rivers and the railroad, and people could live in one suburb and work in another instead of living in the suburbs and working downtown. Neighborhoods became even more racially and economically segregated than they had in the past as middle-class whites moved into the new automobile suburbs and left the poorer African Americans behind in the cities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s03_p05">By the late twentieth century, the automobile had led to a new urban form: the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">edge city</a><span class="glossdef">Sometimes called a “suburban downtown,” a high-density business district that forms outside the limits of a traditional city, often at the intersection of major highways. Edge cities may contain shopping malls, hotels, office parks, and entertainment venues.</span></span>. Edge cities are areas of dense urban development outside the boundaries of the traditional city. They often form at the intersection of major interstate highways and contain shopping malls, office complexes, high-rise apartment buildings, industrial parks, restaurants, and hotels. Sometimes edge cities are called <strong class="emphasis bold">suburban downtowns</strong>. Edge cities have supplanted the CBD as the destination of choice for Americans, whether they are heading to work or to play.</p>

In the explanation of how countries gain national income (<a class="xref" href="berglee_1.0-ch01_s04#berglee_1.0-ch01_s04">Section 1.4 "Globalization and Development"</a>), only primary and secondary activities produce actual physical products, and manufacturing traditionally earns the highest value-added profits. Tertiary activities are selective in gaining national wealth. For example, service activities such as tourism can bring in national wealth if the visitors are from outside the country. Tourism within a country can also influence economic conditions by increasing the amount of consumer spending.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p03">During the colonial era and into the nineteenth century, when the majority of Americans lived on farms and worked in agriculture, most economic activity in the United States took place within the primary economic sector. Today, the primary sector is still an important component of the US economy, but far fewer people are employed in it. For example, less than 1 percent of Americans make their living by farming, but agricultural output has continued to grow because of advancements in mechanization and the development of high-tech seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides. The United States has been able to export surplus agricultural output to other parts of the world. Fewer people work in coal mines than in the past, but because of new mining technologies and methods such as mountaintop removal, coal production remains high.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p04">The geographic distribution of primary activities depends both on the location of natural features such as physical geography and climate and on the location of the market for a particular crop or resource. The nineteenth-century German economist Johann von Thünen created a model that predicted land use around a central market. In his theory, land closest to the market would be used to produce crops that were expensive to transport, such as dairy. Land far from the market would be used for the production of crops that were less expensive to transport and less perishable, such as grain. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">von Thünen model</a><span class="glossdef">A model that seeks to predict agricultural land use in a closed economic system, with only one market surrounded by land of uniform quality.</span></span> predicts a series of concentric rings surrounding a central market, with each ring producing a different kind of crop. If the von Thünen model is applied at a much larger scale to the United States as a whole, with the densely populated urban zone from Boston to Washington, DC (called a <strong class="emphasis bold">megalopolis</strong>), used as the central market, the model does a fairly good job predicting the United States’ agricultural land use. Dairy farms are found close to the market, grain farms are farther away, and ranch lands used for livestock production are even farther away.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p05">Anything that involves the processing of raw materials—manufacturing—is a secondary activity. As the United States moved into the Industrial Revolution and into the mid-twentieth century, the percentage of the US workforce involved in manufacturing grew from almost nothing until it peaked in the late 1970s. It was the main area of economic growth for decades. Although manufacturing was present in most areas of the country, it was focused in the northeastern United States and along the Great Lakes. Factories were close both to the reserves of labor and to the markets for manufactured products found in the densely populated Northeast. The steel industry was located in Pittsburgh and its environs because of the area’s access to iron ore (mined in Minnesota and transported via the Great Lakes) and to coal (mined in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and other parts of Appalachia).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p06">As manufacturing has grown in other parts of the world, the secondary economic sector has declined in the United States. US labor statistics indicate that the United States lost about five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2010.<span class="footnote" hidden id="berglee_1.0-fn04_003">Sheryl Nance-Nash, “‘Made in America’ Leaders That Really Make a Difference,” Daily Finance, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/07/01/made-in-america-leaders-that-really-make-a-difference/">http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/07/01/made-in-america-leaders-that-really-make-a-difference/</a>.</span> Many of these jobs were lost to countries with lower labor costs, such as Mexico or China.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p07">The third group of economic activities takes place in the tertiary and quaternary sectors, commonly known as the <strong class="emphasis bold">service sector</strong>. Tertiary and quaternary activities create services, not physical products. Service jobs include everything from engineering to finance, restaurants to sports, and childcare to medicine. The tertiary sector makes up more than three quarters of the US economy, as measured by its share of the <strong class="emphasis bold">gross domestic product (GDP)</strong>, which is the total value of all goods and services produced in a country in a given year. The GDP is then divided by the country’s population to provide a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">GDP per capita</a><span class="glossdef">The total value of goods and services produced by a country, divided by the population.</span></span> statistic.

        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p08">These figures show that the United States has shifted to a postindustrial service economy. The rise of the <strong class="emphasis bold">information age</strong> in the latter part of the twentieth century shifted the workforce into the information sector. By the start of the twenty-first century, less than 2 percent of the US workforce was employed in agriculture, 15 percent in industry, and the rest in services (18 percent) and information activities (65 percent).</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p09">The locations of service-sector jobs are much more flexible than are jobs in the primary or secondary sectors. They are called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">footloose jobs</a><span class="glossdef">Jobs that are not tied to a specific location because of access to raw materials or manufacturing infrastructure. These jobs can be carried out in any location.</span></span>: an accountant can live in New York or in Denver, whereas it is much more difficult for factories to move from one place to another and it is impossible for farms to relocate. Many of the information-technology jobs are emerging in the southern regions of the United States called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Sun Belt</a><span class="glossdef">The region extending through the American South, Southwest, and into California.</span></span>. Southern cities such as Atlanta, Dallas, and Phoenix are centers of innovation and population growth. The warmer climate, combined with a lower cost of living and less congestion, makes the Sun Belt an attractive location for emerging information-based companies. Note that the popularity of the South and West for service-sector jobs only came about after the invention and adoption of air-conditioning. Air-conditioning was not widespread until after the Second World War in the 1950s.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p10">While the population of the Southern states has increased, the population of some Northern states has decreased. The Sun Belt has always been a destination for people escaping the harsh winters of the Northern states. This has usually been only a seasonal transition. However, the new trend is one of permanent growth because of the increase in information technologies and in the service industry. Emerging companies looking to establish their businesses have targeted major cities from the Carolinas to the Southwest.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Migration Patterns</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s05_p01">The United States has not only undergone a massive rural-to-urban shift in its population; intermigration within the United States from one region to another has also been prevalent. Each of the US regions has witnessed changes in demographics because of migration patterns.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s05_p02">In the agricultural regions of the United States, such as the <strong class="emphasis bold">Midwest</strong>, the migration pattern has been caused by changes in farm technology. Portions of the United States were opened up for agriculture because of the Homestead Act of 1862, where each person could receive 160 acres from the government to start a farm. They could keep the acres if they lived on them and farmed them for a period of years. In the 1800s, 160 acres was enough land to support a family if conditions were appropriate. The Industrial Revolution brought about improved farm equipment and technology. Larger and more expensive tractors and improved farming methods pushed the small farmers to sell out. Farms increased in size and fewer people were required to operate them. Since fewer farm workers are needed in rural areas, there has been a major rural-to-urban shift in the population. Central cities are increasing in population, while small towns and rural areas in the Midwest and across the nation are decreasing in population.</p>

US citizens have pushed American corporations to become a major force in the world markets. Products and franchises from the United States are being distributed throughout the world. Items such as fast food, computers, news networks, and Hollywood movies have become the products of choice in countries across the globe.

        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s06_p02">US news networks, such as CNN, are so dominant that small countries, having no resources to create networks, rely on the US networks to deliver their world news. US fast food franchises, of which McDonald’s is the largest, exist in over one hundred countries. Despite humble beginnings in Arkansas, Walmart grew to become the world’s largest corporation. It has become the buyer and seller of retail trade that shapes and molds cultural attitudes and fashions internationally.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s06_p03">The size of the US population (more than 310 million strong as of 2010) and the country’s vast resource base have allowed it to become a world military superpower. After the fall of the Soviet Union, the United States became the most powerful military force in the world. The United States has also dominated the world’s economy and its communications networks. The advancements of multinational corporations have in essence enabled the sale of America to the rest of the world. The selling of American products and the large consumer market in the United States have provided the profits that have fueled global economic markets.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s06_p04">The United States has become a worldwide franchise of its own. Corporate colonialism has advanced the American brand to a level that is now synonymous with consumerism, success, and power worldwide. Media advancements have promoted the concept of the American Dream across the seven seas. The reaction of the global community includes both admiration and disdain. Many view Americanism as interchangeable with globalization. Some welcome it; others reject it. The country of Iran is an example of this dichotomy. Young people in Iran wearing blue jeans gather in secret to watch American television programming from a hidden illegal satellite dish, while at the same time the anti-American forces in their government condemn America as decadent, immoral, and imperialistic.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s06_p05">Corporate colonialism has become a dominant force impacting the global cultural fabric. Supporters appreciate access to American goods and services, while opponents claim that the English language and the American corporate franchise system are destroying the culture and heritage of untold millions who see their unique traditional ways of life being overshadowed and destroyed.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="berglee_1.0-ch04_s02_s06_p06">Some argue that American television advertisements exemplify a trend that supports conformity and uniformity in American culture. They contend that America’s unique cultural diversity, which historically has provided ingenuity and creativity, is being eroded by the franchising of similar retail products, fast food, professional sports, and Hollywood entertainment that stifle the creative will of the American people. Others continue to see opportunities to pursue the American Dream and believe that innovation and ideas continue to emerge in spite of these trends.</p>
